# remedi

Remedi revolutionizes post-operative care by transforming complex discharge docs into actionable phone alerts, boosting patient compliance. This enhances recovery, cuts readmissions, and saves costs.

Remedi is a mobile application supporting both IOS and Android. Patients can log in to see their previous procedures, summarized concisely. Each procedure has actionable items (such as taking pills, doing physical therapy) and an appointment schedule, along with an FAQ section tied to that procedure.
